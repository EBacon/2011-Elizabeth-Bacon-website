              with Federal Drug Administration (FDA) guidelines can actually help 
              speed delivery of your products to market, and offers a variety 
              of benefits to marketing, development, and sales organizations. 
              The FDA desires medical device manufacturers to thoroughly document 
              their processes and rationale around product design and development, 
              with specific regard to Human Factors (HF) considerations. Proper 
              compliance with FDA regulatory guidelines allows the agency to evaluate 
              whether sound thinking went into the product, and so determine whether 
              it will be safe for both patients and medical staff.[1] Ultimately, 
              the success of your product in the marketplace might depend upon 
              its fundamental usability. </font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b> 
              FDA's Human Factors Approach</b><br>
              When evaluating products, the FDA looks for good Human Factors design.[1] 
              What is HF? Human Factors is a discipline devoted to determining 
              the cognitive and perceptual issues that affect different kinds 
              of users, and understanding the environmental context of a specific 
              product's use. The FDA specifically cites <em>mental models </em>as 
              a tool for understanding how people conceptualize their environment 
              as well as their general goals and tasks. One of the key ways to 
              gain insight into people's mental models is by interviewing and 
              studying customers in their own environment. The data obtained with 
              such field research can be modeled as personas, contexts of use, 
              and usage scenarios. Personas are archetypes that represent the 
              needs of a group of users, and they encapsulate interactive experience 
              goals that drive good technology development. </font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Developing 
              Clear Product Requirements</b><br>
              A company that performs research and persona development to create 
              good, HF-informed products equips itself with clear user-centered 
              requirements even before the process of building a product has begun. 
              The FDA notes that &quot;these efforts reduce the necessity for 
              modifications during implementation and reduce costly updates.&quot; 
              [2] With less potential for change during the development process, 
              the result is a shorter development cycle, which gets your product 
              to market faster and saves money. In addition, having a clear understanding 
              of customer requirements from the beginning of the development process 
              better prepares companies to assess the potential impacts of any 
              necessary adjustments to the product definition. This shared vision 
              helps internal sales, support and educational staff, as well.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Benefits 
              of Human Factors Education</b><br>
              In its paper, &quot;Do It by Design: An Introduction to Human Factors 
              in Medical Devices and Radiological Health,&quot; the FDA states: 
              &quot;Educating both technical and managerial staff about human 
              factors also provides long-term benefits to the organization.&quot;[1] 
              By training employees in the values of a human approach to technology, 
              people working on interactive products can become more fully invested 
              in both the safety of patients and the quality of the user experience, 
              two aspects of product design with which the FDA is vitally concerned. 
              This customer-centric approach to technology development also results 
              in a product that is intuitive and user-friendly, which reduces 
              the amount of user training needed and thereby cuts associated costs. 
              </font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Documenting 
              Design &amp; Development</b><br>
              The FDA, and international regulatory agencies such as TUV, usually 
              evaluate medical products solely on the basis of their documentation, 
              and occasional auditing of corporate practices. For this reason, 
              documentation of both product and process must begin at the onset 
              of development, rather than while or after the product is built. 
              Medical device documentation needs to delve deeper into design substance 
              and rationale than standard requirements documents or user manuals. 
              For the benefit of regulatory agencies, these specifications should 
              detail HF considerations for target users, and describe how the 
              product eliminates potential errors through good user-centered design 
              practices such as usability testing. </font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>What 
              HF Means for Your Company</b><br>
              Ultimately, the Human Factors processes that the FDA recommends 
              provide advantages above and beyond FDA approval to the companies 
              that use them. Investment in field research to understand users' 
              goals and needs solidifies the definition of a successful product, 
              while awareness of human considerations sets the right priorities. 
              Creating documentation capable of meeting FDA guidelines can supply 
              a great deal of source material for marketing and sales collateral. 
              Finally, Human Factors processes can significantly reduce the duration 
              of the product development cycle, and deliver a fundamentally better 
              product more quickly to market.</font> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>
